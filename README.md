## 📌Overview:
I have created an interactive E-Commerce sales dashboard to analyze sales trends, quantity sold, and profit gained. The dashboard provides valuable insights into state-wise performance, top customers, category-wise quantity distribution,sum of quantity by payment modes(in percentage), sum of profit in by month, and top profit-generating sub-categories.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Power BI (Visualization, Power query, DAX)
- Ms-Excel (Data source)

## 🎯 Goal and 🚧 Challenges:
The goal was to design a dashboard that tracks key sales and profit metrics, identifies top-performing customers and products, and highlights quarterly, state-wise, and category-based trends. A challenge faced was handling and organizing the data for clear, interactive visuals.

## 🔧 Key Features:
- KPIs for Total Sales Amount, Total Profit, Quantity Sold, and Average Order Value (AOV).
- State-wise sales analysis.
- Category-wise quantity distribution.
- Top 4 customers by sales amount.
- Sales breakdown by payment mode.
- Monthly profit trend visualization.
- Top 5 sub-categories by profit.

## 💡Impact:
- Enabled analysis of sales and profit across quarters, states, and categories.
- Helped identify the most profitable states, categories, and sub-categories.
- Made it easy to track top customers and their contribution to sales.
- Allowed quick comparison of payment modes and their share in total sales.
- Highlighted monthly profit fluctuations for better decision-making.
